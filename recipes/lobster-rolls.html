  <h2>Description</h2>
  <h3>The best seafood sandwich you can have <em>in existence.</em></h3>
  <p>
    A native dish to New Englanders, it's served in a hot-dog style bun filled
    with scrumptious lobster meat.
    <br />
    The combination of creamy mayonnaise and light butter keeps the inside soft
    and outside golden and crusty.
  </p>

      In a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, lime juice, hot pepper
      sauce, salt and pepper until well blended. Mix in the green onion and
