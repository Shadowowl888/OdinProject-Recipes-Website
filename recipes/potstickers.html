    later.

  <h2>Ingriedients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
    <li>1 cup shredded green cabbage</li>
    <li>3 ounces shiitake mushrooms, diced</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, pressed</li>
    <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon hoisin</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Sriracha*, or more, to taste</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon white pepper</li>
    <li>36 won ton wrappers</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil Soy sauce, for serving</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      In a large bowl, combine pork, cabbage, mushrooms, garlic, green onions,
      hoisin, ginger, sesame oil, Sriracha and white pepper.
    </li>
    <li>
      To assemble the dumplings, place wrappers on a work surface. Spoon 1
      tablespoon of the pork mixture into the center of each wrapper. Using your
      finger, rub the edges of the wrappers with water. Fold the dough over the
      filling to create a half-moon shape, pinching the edges to seal.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add potstickers in
      a single layer and cook until golden and crisp, about 2-3 minutes per
      side.
    </li>
    <li>Serve immediately with soy sauce, if desired.</li>
